### About 
Travel Companion is a full-stack web application. As the name suggests it is for everyone who has a knack for travelling and exploring. We often visit a place and share the pictures on social media. This, doesn't help our fellow travellers if they are not active in such platforms. With travel companion you can review a certain location on our integrated map and drop a review about the place. This way, it helps someone to check more about the spot/place/city.
